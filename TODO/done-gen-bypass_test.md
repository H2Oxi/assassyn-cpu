# done: Bypass Test Reference Check Implementation

**Date**: Oct 23, 2024
**Task**: todo-gen-bypass_test.md
**File**: test/unit-test/guidance/bypass.py

## Summary

Implemented comprehensive reference checking for the bypass functionality in the CPU pipeline to verify correct timing behavior of bypass signals.

## What Was Done

### 1. Analyzed Signal Timing

Examined the simulation logs to understand the timing relationships:

- **reg_wr_bypass**: Shows register write data 1 cycle ahead of when it appears in the actual register
- **fifo_bypass**: Shows FIFO data 1 cycle ahead of when it gets popped from the FIFO

Example timing analysis (from logs):
```
Cycle @3.00:
  [bypass] reg_wr_bypass: 2    <- Bypass sees write data
  [bypass] fifo_bypass: 1      <- Bypass sees FIFO data
  [real] reg: 0                <- Register still has old value
  [real] fifo_data: 0          <- FIFO pop shows old value

Cycle @4.00:
  [bypass] reg_wr_bypass: 4    <- New bypass value
  [bypass] fifo_bypass: 2      <- New bypass value
  [real] reg: 2                <- Now matches previous reg_wr_bypass
  [real] fifo_data: 1          <- Now matches previous fifo_bypass
```

### 2. Implemented Check Function

Added a comprehensive `check(raw)` function that:

1. **Parses simulation logs**: Extracts cycle numbers and signal values from the log output
2. **Validates reg_wr_bypass timing**: Ensures `reg_wr_bypass[N]` equals `reg[N+1]`
3. **Validates fifo_bypass timing**: Ensures `fifo_bypass[N]` equals `fifo_data[N+1]`
4. **Reports results**: Provides clear pass/fail messages with detailed error information

### 3. Test Results

The implementation successfully validates 99 cycles:

```
=== BYPASS CHECK PASSED ===
Verified 99 cycles
✓ reg_wr_bypass is correctly 1 cycle ahead of reg
✓ fifo_bypass is correctly 1 cycle ahead of fifo_data
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Check Algorithm

```python
def check(raw):
    # 1. Parse logs into cycle-indexed dictionary
    # 2. For each consecutive cycle pair (N, N+1):
    #    - Verify: reg_wr_bypass[N] == reg[N+1]
    #    - Verify: fifo_bypass[N] == fifo_data[N+1]
    # 3. Report any timing mismatches as errors
```

### Signal Relationships Verified

- **Register Bypass Path**: Data written to register appears in bypass 1 cycle before being readable from register
- **FIFO Bypass Path**: Data pushed to FIFO appears in bypass 1 cycle before being popped

## Testing

Run the test with:
```bash
python test/unit-test/guidance/bypass.py
```

The test will:
1. Generate simulation logs for 99+ cycles
2. Verify all bypass timing relationships
3. Report pass/fail status with detailed error messages if any

## Files Modified

- `test/unit-test/guidance/bypass.py` - Added complete reference checking implementation in the `check()` function

## Verification Status

✅ All checks passing
✅ 99 cycles verified
✅ Both bypass paths (reg_wr and fifo) validated
✅ Timing relationships confirmed correct
